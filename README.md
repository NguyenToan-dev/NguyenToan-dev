## 💡 About Me

Hello! I'm Nguyen Khanh Toan, a first-year student majoring in Information Technology at the University of Science – Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMUS).

I'm passionate about software development, learning new technologies, and building creative solutions. As I begin my journey in tech, I'm excited to explore areas like Cybersecurity, algorithms, and game development.
